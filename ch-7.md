# Chapter 7 - The Braying Horses

Dinner was a grand affair that night - it was more like a banquet than anything else. However, the children deserved it, having carried heavy loads and been building their den all day. They ate sausages, eggs and bacon by the dozen and only stopped when Sam reminded them that they shouldn't be going back home for food just the day after they had been given heaps of it. Once they had cleaned up, which was rather easy because as soon as something was done cooking it was eaten without being put on plates first, Jessie decided to organize the place. She even managed to find a tin of coffee beans which no-one had put in their bags but was in the den anyway, and promtly put it by the lookout.

"For keeping the lookout awake," she said to herself.

Pouring some water for himself, Johny said, "Tomorrow we should follow the river upstream."

Everyone agreed to this.

"We may find a spring!" said Sam.

"And we could come back on a raft!" said Max.

"Yes," said Jessie, "but not today. I'm too tired."

Everyone laughed, but they all went to bed. Everyone forgot about the lookout, but if they had they would have said that there was no need.

Elsie was woken by the sound of horses braying.

"It's nothing," she said to herself, trying to get back to sleep.

But just then, dappled torchlight shone through the den's covering of leaves. Then she heard voices. Someone was outside - Elsie was too scared to move. She waited for what seemed like hours, though it must have really been only a few minutes. Then she woke up the others. Within a minute everyone was up, although she and the others had to throw some water on Johny, who could be impossible to wake up at times. Once she had told them everything, they all started talking at once.

"Did you recognise the voice?"

"Why did they do it?"

"No, I didn't recognise the voice."

"Perhaps they wanted to cut down the trees!"

"Or steal the horses!"

"I'm remembering something..."

"Are we sure no-one did it for a trick?"

"Ah ha!" said Rose, "What about the treasure!"

"What?" said Max and Jessie.

"Oh yes! The treasure that's supposedly buried somewhere here! Could that be what they're after?"

"Better go to sleep," said Jessie, "so we're ready in the morning."

No-one got to sleep, in fact - but everone wanted everyone else to think they were asleep. Max, thinking he was the only one awake, decided to go to the lookout, and was surprised when Jessie asked him where he was going! However, nothing happened for the rest of the night.
