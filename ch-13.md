# Chapter 13 - Home and More Excitement

The next day, the adults all came to the den.

"We need you to come back home for a bit," said the children's parents.

"But why?" asked all the children at once.

"We're going to catch the intruders - but for our plan to work, you can't be at the land until the plan's in action," replied the parents.

"But after that, you can come back," said Max and Jessie's mother.

"Come to ours and we'll tell you our plan," said the other's father.

So they all went to the house to find out the plan. As they walked past, Marshmallow the horse snorted again, setting everyone off laughing for the rest of the way home.

"We sneaked a different map in front of them while they weren't looking, which told them that the treasure was by the horse paddock," said Uncle Peter.

"And the horses will act as an alarm," continued Sam,

"And then we can go and get them!" finished Jessie.

"You needed to be out of the den, because otherwise, the people wouldn't go near as they'd be worried you'd see them and get suspicious," said Aunt Sue.

"Now we have to wait. One person must always be on watch though, so if the horses make noises, we'll hear them," said Max.

The rest of the day nothing much happened - the most exciting thing that happened was when Elsie spilt some water.

That night, they took turns to listen for the horses. Still nothing. But the next day, something more interesting did happen.

It all started with what they thought was a ringing in their ears, but then Jessie asked, "Does anyone else hear that?"

The horses were braying! Everyone went around to the den, and there, they saw 2 people, definately the people who were also looking for the treasure! Now sure that there were intruders, some of the adults went back to the house to phone the police. Meanwhile, the men kept digging, oblivious to what was going on around them.

"So, now they're here, what do we do untill the police arrive?" whispered Elsie.

"Wait," replied Sam, "and make sure they don't leave."

However, there wasn't much waiting too do, as the police arrived shortly and arrested the 2 men. Then, the adults decided what to do with the money.

"So, I suppose that it ended well after all," said Johny later that day, when they were back at the den.

"Yes," replied Jessie.

"But the real treasure here is the outdoors," said Sam.
