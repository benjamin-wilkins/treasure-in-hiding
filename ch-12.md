# Chapter 12 - A Final Banquet

The children ate a quick lunch before preparing the large meal that was to happen that night. Johny wrote a note `HAVING BANQUET TONIGHT - DON'T BE LATE - AND HAVE A SURPRISE FOR ALL.`

Rose made a list of who was to make what:

```
 - Corned Beef Hash, Salad - Rose
 - Sandwiches, Drop Scones - Johny
 - Pizza Muffins, Flapjack - Jessie
 - Sausages, Potatoes - Max
 - Pasta - Sam & Elsie
```

"And then we'll also have Smores and Ginger Beer, but we don't need to prepare them," she said.

Johny and Rose, having finished preparing their food to be cooked, found that the fire was not big enough for all the food to be cooked on it, and so extended it. Soon the air was filled with the smell of food cooking on the fire.

"Sam, Elsie," said Johny. "Are you finished?"

"Yes," they chorused.

"Let's go and find some things we can use as chairs and tables," Johny continued.

"There's a big tree that had to be cut down as all the branches were trying to get into our house," said Jessie.

"We'll go and find that," said Sam.

So they went to Max and Jessie's house and found a fairly large tree, too big fot them alone to carry, and so knocked at the door of the house and asked for help. The adults cut the log down to the size needed, and then offered to carry it there when they went to the banquet.

"Thank you!" said the three children, and set off again.

Soon, they found some rocks that they thought they could use as chairs, and one at a time, carried them back to the camp. When they had taken the final stone to their camp, the adults arrived with the large log, using some rope to help them carry it. The rocks were put in place for chairs, and the food was taken to the table. Then the chest was taken to the table.

"We found the treasure," said all the children at once.

"Really?" asked all the adults at once.

"Yes," said Rose. "Now, let's open it."

The chest was opened, revealing a shining sight. Inside was Gold, Diamonds, Rubies, and any other kind of valueable gem you can imagine. No-one could speak for a moment. A minute. No-one spoke. 5 minutes. Still no-one spoke. Another 10 minutes. Finally someone broke the silence.

"The treasure is really here?" said Uncle Peter. Then, nudging Sam, Rose, Johny and Elsie's mother "I did tell you it was real."

"Did I say it wasn't?"

"You did say that it may not be true," said Uncle Peter.

"That's different to..."

But she never finished that sentence, because Aunt Sue interupted with a sigh. "Stop it, you too. Now, are we going to eat?"

And everyone started eating, because the food looked so tasty, and it certainly was. Soon, there was little food left, despite the huge amount of food that had been cooked.

"Well, I'm certinly full up," said Rose.

"If I eat any more I feel like I'll burst!" said Elsie.

"Well, don't," said Sam.

Everyone started laughing.

"That was the best meal ever," said Max and Jessie's father, and everyone agreed.

Everyone helped clear the table and tidy up. That was when Jessie remembered something.

"There's some other people looking for the treasure. We need to do something about it, but we're not sure what."

"We'll deal with them," said Aunt Sue. "Now, you still need to go to sleep, and we'll take the treasure to keep it safe until we know what to use it for. We're not staying the night, so goodbye and goodnight!"

More goodnights and goodbyes rose from the children and adults, and a lot of waving took place. Then the children got into bed and all slept peacefully.
