# To the Land

Going to the land was a hard thing - not only was there the fact that there were many things to trip over and hurt yourself on, but also as the land was covered in trees there was no map that could show where you could go and so it was easy to get lost. However, by following the stream that led from the house, they managed to not get lost.

Soon later, Elsie screamed, "Help!"

She had tripped over and fell in a fairly deep ditch - but Johny and Sam had soon got her out. Rose was deep in thought.

"How about we use this as our den?" she asked, after a short silence.

So, they decided to make it into their den. Rose and Johny became very thankful of their penknives' saws, cutting through logs to make them the right size. Sam and Elsie went together and found a good deal of old logs, as well as a lot of litter, such as corrogated iron, incinerator lids and old bricks.

"Better used than left," as Sam said.

Making the den was difficult but progress was made fast. Logs were laid inside and above the ditch, beds were made inside, and a wigwam was made of sticks and covered in tarpaulins for a sitting room and kitchen. A space for the fire was put in the wigwam and an oven was made out of the bricks and corrogated iron. Before long anyone who did not know that they had just arrived and saw the scene would have thought that they had been there for years and years.

"We've even got an oven," Rose said.

"Well I just hope you know what you're doing with it," Sam teased, "and don't burn the place down by mistake."

"Hey!"

"Now, who wants to go exploring?" questioned Johny. Instantly 2 hands shot up. "Well then, Elsie and Sam, let's go!"

"So long as your back in half an hour!" Rose shouted after the others, who had already left.

Rose spent a happy half hour checking that the den was safe, before a loud crash stopped her. Outside the den were Elsie and Sam, almost on top of each other.

"I can tell you have something exiting to say," she remarked.

"There's 2 rivers!" the other 3 said.

"Or at least, 1 river flowing to the house and the other back," Johny continued. "We were silly not to think of where the river came from before, and we can use them to send messages in boats and get messages back from the house!"

"If there's 2 rivers, we should get our water from the one leading to the house," Rose said. "Or at least, that's what mother would say."

"Building a dam will make sure that any messages don't end up too downriver," Sam thought aloud, "so that if we were'nt there the message wouldn't get lost."

"That's a great idea!" exclaimed Johny.

Everyone else agreed, and so they spent the rest of the afternoon happily damming the river.

"We should make another dam for everyone else," said Sam, "so they don't miss a message either."

"Well, I vote we do it tommorow," said Johny, "if we do it today then we'll not have anything to do on any other days."

Rose looked into the trees. "Well, it looks like we've got visitors," she remarked.
