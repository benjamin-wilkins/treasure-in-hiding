# Chapter 6 - The Answer and a Bigger Den

Shouts of 'Yes!' could be heard through the camp.

"Oh, what are they playing at this time?" sighed Rose.

Johny shrugged.

"It's an answer!" shouted Elsie, running into the clearing.

She had clearly been the one shouting as her throat was getting hoarse. Sam ran into the clearing, panting.

"And it says yes!" said Sam.

"We'd better tell them," said Rose. "But how are they to know we want to speak to them?"

"First, check in the horse paddock. Otherwise, we'll have to hope an owl hoot will get their attention."

Jessie and Max were not in the horse paddock. However, an owl hoot was not nessarsary as they were in the garden.

"It's yes, if your parents let you," said Sam.

"Well then, we can go," said Jessie. "Our parents said as long as yours allowed."

"We'll be back in half an hour," said Max. "We need to pack,"

Half an hour later, Jessie and Max arrived, with seven or eight bags, all full.

"Our parents said we might as well take some food," Jessie explained.

"And a lot, at that," said Max, "Where's the camp?"

Rose led the way.

"We'll need to extend it a bit," she said, "but apart from that it's great!"

Throughout the rest of the morning, everyone was busy. Sam, Elsie and Max were extending the sleeping area to fill the full ditch, while Rose, John and Jessie were constructing another wigwam, but with two entrances, one of them to connect it to the other wigwam.

They finished just before lunch.

It was then that Sam suggested, "Shouldn't we have a lookout post in that tree?"

So, straight after lunch, everyone was back at work again, hauling branches up trees, making rope ladders and hammering together the lookout.

"It's a good job there's a bit of extra space where no-one's sleeping - we now have a way straight up into the lookout," said Max.

"We could put some logs round the tree to create a passageway going up," suggested Jessie, "with a door in the side so we can get in and out without going into the den."

Everyone agreed to this idea and before long there was a small hut at the top of the large tree.

"So, who's going first?"

Elsie was the first to put up her hand, so she went up. It was only a minute before she said, "People coming from the horse paddock and others from the house." 

Not long later, voices could be heard. They were the children's parents' voices.

"They're not living in a tree, are they?" said a voice, which turned out to be that of Max and Jessies' mother.

The other children's father replied, "Last I knew, they were living in a ditch,"

The parents arrived, and the children rushed out of the den.

"It's a great den!" shouted Max.

"What's the bit in the tree for?" asked the parents.

"Lookout," said Sam.

"Well, we only came to checkup on you," said Jessie and Max's father, "so we'll just have a look and then we'll go"

The adults all agreed that it was great, but that "any more children would make it take up too much space." They were just leaving with a chorus of goodbyes coming from them and their children, but Max and Jessie's mother remembered something.

"We'd better give you this," she said giving them another basket, full of food, which no-one had noticed before. "Goodbye!"

The children waved back, only stopping long after the adults had left. They ate dinner and went to bed. Everyone, even Max and Jessie, who had not slept in a den before, fell asleep quickly.
