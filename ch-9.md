# Chapter 9 - The Map

"Everyone - what are we going to do? We can't just let them find the treasure," said Johny.

It was morning and the meeting had begun. However, not everyone was there because Sam and Elsie were making breakfast, with Jessie to supervise, and Max was tidying up the kitchen and bedroom after all the tins had fallen onto the floor and rolled all over the place.

"Look!" shouted Max.

The others were in the bedrooms in a moment. They all puzzled round a sheet of paper.

"I found it under the bedding," said Max.

It was a mysterious piece of paper indeed. It had circles and lines, and had writing on it, though no-one could read it. Something attracted Rose's attention.

"Look in the bottom left! That's our great-great-great grandfather's signiture!" she exclaimed. "I saw it once on a family tree once - where the family tree is now I don't know - but that's the same signiture!"

Sam was looking at another thing.

"I think we're there," he said, pointing to the paper.

"What?" everyone said.

"Well, look at it - there's a squiggle there. We followed the river yesterday - The line almost exactly follows the course of the river. If so, this is a map. If you look to where the river starts, this semicircle is the hill. Then, look at the river - there are some boxes. One of these must be the horse paddock - the closest one most upstream. The one next to it must be your house, Max and Jessie - and the last box is our house. Therefore, we are here - but I cannot work out what this X is," he explained.

"I think I know - It's the treasure!" said Elsie, "Remember - X marks the spot."

"Really?" said John.

"I think it is," said Rose. "Remember - It was our great-great-great grandparents who buried the treasure. It would make sense if there was a map for it."

"So, we've decided," said Jessie. "We're going to find the treasure."
