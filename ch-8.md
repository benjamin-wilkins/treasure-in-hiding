# Chapter 8 - Journey Upriver

The children woke up to a glorious day. Every one of them had forgotten about what happened last night, and soon everyone was splashing in the pool the dam had created. Actually, Max wasn't in the pool, because it was his turn to make breakfast. After Max shouted to the others that they were ready to eat though, everyone promptly got changed and dry, almost as if they were never playing in the water. Despite breakfast being small, everyone felt full up and could not eat any more. Then they started to pack for the expedition upriver.

"I'll send a message to our parents," said Sam. "Do you think that '`EXPLORING UPRIVER - BACK BY SUNSET`' will do?"

Everyone said yes to that suggestion.

"Bring your swimming things for the way back," said Jessie to everyone.

"I'll make lunch," said Johny.

"Remember the rope for the rafts," said Elsie.

It was a happy group of explorers who were following the river upstream a few minutes later in the cool shade of the trees. Elsie saw something.

"Look! It's someone else's footprints!"

"Probably from years gone by," said Max.

"No - these are new," said Sam, kneeling down to take a look.

"Be on the lookout!" said Rose in the loudest possible whisper.

"But that's back at camp," whispered Elsie.

"You know what I mean," answered Rose.

After quite a while, the woods became thicker so that you could only see about a metre in front of you. Rose, who was the only one still looking for anyone else, gave up trying to see through the trees.

"The river's lucky. It can go through this bit of forest much more easily than we can," said Sam, bumping into another tree.

Fortunately, it wasn't much later that they arrived at a long-forgotten part of the land - a large hill surrounded by the trees. The river continued upwards, before it became so small the children almost lost sight of it completely. Then they found a small spring.

"The source of the river!" shouted Elsie in happiness.

They ate the sandwiches silently, and then Johny checked the time on his watch.

"How could it be half past 2 already?" he asked, jumping up. "Everyone, back down the mountain and build our raft - we need to get back on time!"

They started to walk back downriver. It wasn't long before they came in and then out of the thick part of the woods, to the point where there was enough water to actually go rafting. Everone got a bit of the rope and began making the rafts.

"OK, so we tie this log to this log with a clove hitch, and then tie on this log with a whole hitch?" asked Elsie.

Everyone laughed.

"It's a double half hitch, not a whole hitch," laughed Rose, "but you're not the first one!"

"It means 2 of something called a half hitch," said Max. "However, I entirely agree with you that it's a silly name."

It wasn't long before they had finished their raft and were getting into their swimming clothes in case they fell in.

"But if we fall in, won't our bags - and what's inside - get wet?" asked Sam.

"Yes, but I've got some sealable plastic bags," said Jessie, handing the bags out.

Everyone put everything inside the small bags, which they then put inside their backpacks.

"Ready? 3, 2, 1, Push!" shouted Johny, while they all heaved the heavy raft into the water and got on. Soon they were moving slowly along the river.

"Stop!" whispered Elsie, holding onto a tree and pulling the raft towards the bank where the current was weakest. "They're there!"

And sure enough, 2 people were talking in the same voices that Elsie had heard on the previous night.

"They definitely said something about treasure," whispered Rose. "Now, push off- we don't want to get caught!"

They were soon back at the den, stopping off to say hello to the horses and then continuing down to the house to have a quick chat.

"Tomorrow we really need to decide what to do about those people," said Johny.

"And whether we'll look for the treasure," yawned Max.

"Oh, you've set everyone off yawning now!" said Rose, before yawning. "Well, everyone to bed."
