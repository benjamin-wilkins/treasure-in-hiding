# Messages and Marshmallow

"Oh, you're so lucky," said Jessica. "I wish we could come to camp with you."

"Well, you do have horses," pointed out Sam.

"Yes, but you can't go exploring in a horse."

"Well, we can eat lunch," said Rose.

They were all sitting down just next to the horse paddock. Suddenly, something snorted.

"Oh you cheeky Marshmallow," laughed Jessica at a horse, who had it's head through the bars in the fencing and was trying to lick Sam.

Everyone laughed.

"I've been thinking," said Johny. "Perhaps you could come with us."

"What do you mean?"

"Well, not so long ago, Mother and Father asked if we wanted anyone else to come with us, but no-one wanted to."

"Let's hope they agree," said Sam.

"Ask them next time you can," said Max.

"I'll send a post," said Rosie.

Soon they had finished lunch, and Rose, Max, Jessica and Johny started talking about cooking techniques, which soon led to a debate over whether you should use the claw or the bridge. They only stopped when they noticed the time.

"You need to stop arguing now," said Elsie. "It's 4 o'clock already!"

"Yes, it really is," said Rose. "We need to get back to camp!"

"Goodbye! Goodbye! Goodbye!" came the children's voices.

"Snort!" came the voice of Marshmallow the horse.

"You startled me!" said Rose.

Once again, everyone laughed.

When they got back, Sam found a raft in the river. It was an extremely makeshift raft, made out of an old plastic drink bottle, but there was a message inside.

Each of them read it.

```

Sorry we were unable to write sooner - we had a lot to do when we got home, just when your stick did!

How are you after a night on the land?

Got to go - more to do,

Your Father and Mother

```

They drafted a reply.

```

Well done on getting back when the stick did!

Hard last night, but first night always hardest.

Met Max and Jessica from next door - could come?

Goodbye,

Johny, Sam, Rose and Elsie

```
