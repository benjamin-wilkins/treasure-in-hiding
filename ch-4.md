# First Night and the Horses

As many say, the first night camping is the hardest. No-one got to sleep that night. When they were at the house they could ignore the trickle of the stream. Now, no-one could. The camp was silent for a while, but then Rose said something.

"Someone ought to be on watch."

Everyone volunteered.

"Well, we could all be on watch," said Johny.

So, everyone was awake, watching for the first part of the night. Elsie soon fell asleep.

"I wish I could fall asleep like that," said Johny.

No one spoke for a while. It was so quiet that soon Rose thought the others, who were lying down, were asleep.

"Did you hear that," Rose asked, mostly to herself.

"What?" said Sam.

"Oh, I don't think it could have been anything really - it's likely just a rabbit," Rose yawned. "Anyway, I'm just too tired!"

Then she left and went to bed. A little later, Johny and Sam did too. Soon, everyone was asleep.

The next morning, Rose and Johny woke up to find Sam and Elsie gone.

"Oh where are they? Just one day and they've got lost," said Rose.

Suddenly, the others ran into the den. Rose gave them a stern telling off.

"But it was only 5 minutes!"

"5 minutes is a long time of worrying where you two have gone off too."

"But we found some horses!"

"Really?" asked Johny.

"Yes! Just across the stream!" said Elsie, once again unable to contain her exitment.

"Was that what we heard last night?" wondered Rose. "Well, it can do no harm to go and see."

Across the river leading down to the house there was a fence. Behind the fence were some horses.

"I think I know who's horses they are," said Johny. "Remember when father said that the people next door kept horses here? Well, we've found where they're kept."

Soon the horses went away to the other side of the field.

"Look! There's someone there!"

And there was. In fact, there were 2 people. They came up and said hello. It turned out that they were called Max and Jessie, and that they lived in the house next door.

Rose had an idea.

"How about we eat lunch together?"

After a long discussion of who should take what, they finally split up again to prepare lunch, eat breakfast and do the morning jobs.
