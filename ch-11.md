# Chapter 11 - Digging

The next day, everyone woke up and went to the large clearing. Then, they looked around for the bag of flour, and saw it in the trees.

"So, it's somewhere round here?" asked Johny.

"Yes," answered Rose. "Let's get going!"

So they started digging and found nothing all morning. Every time someone hit a stone, pulling it out with shaking hands for fear of breaking something valueable, everyone was soon disapointed that it was not treasure. Then, Elsie called out.

"Look!"

They all came over and saw she was holding something.

"String!" said Sam. "Dig it up! It must lead somewhere!"

They found the string leading them through the trees to the river. Then it went along the bottom of the river, though under a layer of mud, into the clearing and up the hill. Then it stopped.

"Were we sitting on it that lunch?" asked Max.

"Well, I've found a note. It reads: `WELL DONE FOR FOLLOWING THE TRAIL HERE. DIG DOWN AND YOU WILL FIND THE TREASURE. BUT, BEAR IN MIND THAT THE REAL TREASURE IS THE OUTDOORS.`"

So, once more, all the children set to work digging. They were digging for a while, but then heard a 'clink' noise. Not like the sound of spades hitting stones earlier that day, but a metalic sound. They dug down around the object and heaved a wooden chest out of the hole. The treasure had been found at last.

"Well then, open it," urged Elsie.

"Perhaps not," said Rose. "Let's have a banquet in celebration, and invite round the adults. We'll open it there."

"What about the intruders?" asked Sam.

"Oh, not them. Let's just tell the parents and see what they think at the banquet."

"Are you coming?" shoued Rose. "We have a banquet to make!"

"And we'll probably still have leftover food," said Max.

"Well, come on then!"
