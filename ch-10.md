# Chapter 10 - Where's the Treasure?

After eating breakfast, everyone returned to the map. They knew where the X was on the map - that was easy - but where was it in real life?

"So, It's near the clearing with the hill," said Jessie.

"And likely not in the ring of dense forest, as it's impossible to dig there," said Sam.

"So where is it?" said Max.

"I think," said Johny, "It's somewhere on the other side of the hill to the river"

"Yes," said Sam.

"Look!" said Jessie, "One thing is clear about where it is. The river goes this way." Here she pointed at the river on the map, "but draw a line across the map, following the line the river makes going down the hill. The X is on that line! Draw a line between your house and our house and continue it - it runs through the X!"

"So, we'll split into three parties," said Johny. "Me and Elsie, Rose and Sam, Jessie and Max."

"But why three?" asked Jessie.

"Two to follow the lines we've drawn and one to keep an eye on the enemy," said Johny. "Jessie, Max - you follow the river line. Rose and Sam - you follow the house line. Me and Elsie will find the intruders."

Everyone went to the houses to find any spades that may be of use. While there, they also got even more food from the parents, despite already having full cupboards, and made an extra copy of the map. Then the 3 groups split up and while Jessie Max, Rose and Sam were following the lines, Johny and Elsie were keeping an eye on the enemy. The line-followers found that it was hard to stay in a straight line, and Johny and Elsie, saw them all going towards the camp and getting flour.

"What are you doing?" asked Elsie.

"Getting flour to drop every so often, to make it easier if we have to go round something," replied Jessie.

"Good idea," said Johny, "and it will also help if the some get there before others," said Johny.

"And we'll have to dig for a lot after we've found it," said Sam.

"And make sure the enemy doesn't find out," said Max.

"Oh well," said Rose. "Well, the sooner we get on the sooner we'll find it."

So they split up once more, and soon Johny and Elsie had found the people. It wasn't very hard for them really because the 2 men seemed to be having an argument.

"You said it would be easy!" one of them was saying. "That we'd just come here and dig it up. What you didn't say was that it could be anywhere here. If we're searching much longer then I'm giving up and going home. We've been here for weeks and I don't intend to stay for a year!"

"Well we are just coming here and picking it up," said the other. "We just don't know where from. And anyway, it's not my fault the map disappeared!"

This went on and on for a while. Meanwhile, Max and Jessie had found something.

"Look! More flour!" said Jessie.

"The others must be near!" said Max. "Noew, the house is that way, so they are this way!"

Max and Jessie started running, and soon Sam and Rose heard them. They got up and started running back to where the flour paths met.

"How will we know it's here?" asked Jessie. "We don't want to spend the whole of every day looking!"

"We can put a flag in the trees! The intruders will be too busy digging to see a flag if it's above them!" said Sam. "Anyone got anything?"

They did have something. It was actually the bag the flour, which by now had all been used on the ground, had been in, and was large and waterproof as it had contained a large amount of flour. They hooked it onto a tree branch. Then, as it was getting late, they went back to camp, where they foud the others, who hadn't wanted to listen any more to the argument and didn't think that the intruders would ever stop. That night, everyone slept well and dreamt of the treasure.
