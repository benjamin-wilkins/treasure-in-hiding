# Chapter 3 - The Visitors

Suddenly 2 people appeared through the trees.

"Mum! Dad!" shouted Elsie.

"How did you know where to find us?" puzzled Sam.

"Easily. We saw where you went. And soon we heard splashing - and more importantly - your voices," said their father.

"That's a nice dam - but where's the camp?" asked mother.

"This way."

Soon they were at the camp, and ate a meal of corned beef on crackers, followed by cake, in the wigwam, and showed the beds in the ditch.

"But there's more to it than this," said Johny.

"The stream goes from here to the house and back," said Rose.

"And we can send messages by boat!" said Elsie, unable to contain her exitment.

"And that's what the dam is for!" said their father.

"Yes," said Sam, "as well as to create a pool. It's great!"

"Yes, it is. Now, I'm afraid we'd better be going, or else everyone will be wondering where we are," said their father.

"Goodbye!" said mother and father together.

A chorus of goodbyes rose.

"Try and get back before this stick with a yellow leaf!" shouted Sam, dropping a stick in the water.

"Will they do it or not?" asked Elsie.

"They'll probably send a reply by boat," replied Sam.
